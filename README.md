## Overview

### Problem Statement

* Associates often misses out on 
important organization wide 
announcement/events/programs emails currently (Ex. Hackathons, 
ESPP, Org Club Events etc.) due to 
working from client assets/network.

* Absence of acknowledgement 
mechanism from associates to 
organization administration for such 
key announcements leading to lower 
participation.

### Solution

We have built an announcement 
management system. 
* This system centrally manages and 
integrates the announcements with 
the frequently used apps / portals by 
the associates Ex. “Timesheet apps” 
even in absence of associate not on
EPAM assets/network.
* This system has business rules for self 
managing and scope for analytics 
capabilities & intelligence

### Benefits

* Increased associates' participation on 
such announcements/events/programs.
* Scope for better decision making for 
future announcement / events / 
programs of Organization.
* Automated Announcement 
management system with self 
management capabilities
* Increased employee participation and 
satisfaction.
